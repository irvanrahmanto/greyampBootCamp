    <h3>The answer :</h3>

    <p>
        <b >Lorem Ipsum</b>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        <b >standard</b> dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown <b>printer</b> took a galley of type and scrambled it
        to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
        but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
